# Non-Local_Curvature
A program to programatically explore non-local curvature.

The nonlocal mean curvature is the average curvature aroud a curve (open or closed) specified at a point. The purpose of this repository is compute the NonLocal mean curvature for functions in two dimensions. By hand, these integrals are sometimes only able to be estimated.
